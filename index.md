I am a sociology major at New York University.

I enjoy social data science, spreadsheets, linguistics, geography, old movies, and classical music. I am trying to get better at photography, playing piano, and writing (thus the blog).

This fall I am studying abroad in Prague, Czechia. Consequently, this blog doubles as a record of my travels.
